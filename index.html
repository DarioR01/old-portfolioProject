                <p>I started as a magician, but then I had no one to show my magic tricks to, I stopped doing magic and tried cardistry instead, I am not that good at it but people still look at me with surprised faces when I perform it.
this hobby taught me how to be resilient, gave me good hand practice, and showed me that a simple solution is not always bad.</p>

                <p>Programming is both a skill and an hobbies of mine. I always loved programming. However I believe programming is more of an applied skill rather than a passtime. In my opinion it is just an instrument used to help those who uses it to achieve their goals. Coding is used to make solution to everyday problem but with no problem it won't achieve anything.</p>

                  <p>This is a mathematical problem that states:</p>
                  <p>On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has n bedrooms arranged in a row. Each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that room.
                     One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess' sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will open it and consent to marry him. What is the best strategy for the prince to follow?</p>
                  <p>The problem it self is easy to understand, however it is really hard to figure the best strategy that the prince can use.</p>
                  <p>I decided that I would need some sample data, and because of that I decided to create a program that simulates the action of the prince and princess in order for me to understand what it is going on in a better way, the simulation data woud have been stored in an excel file where I later could have analysed the data.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Below is the code I used and the excel sample with 4 doors.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="Resources\Code\dataWith4Doors.csv">Excel File (Click to download)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="Resources\Code\princeSearchForPrincess.py">Code in python (Click to download)</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <p>I will leave you the joy of finding the solution for each number of doors.</p>
                  <p>NB: there is no general solution, each number of door has a unique solution.</p>

                  My first videogame is a project I submitted as my A-level computer science coursework.
                  This project was beyond my programming skills; however, as I love challenges, I decided that I would have created it nevertheless.
                  I went over so many challenges with my code, and I had little to no help, as not even my teacher could aid me.
                  I started the project by watching tons of tutorials, and by the end, my programming knowledge and skills were beyond the required skills set for A-levels.
                  The game, based on times tables, was intended for kids that struggle to understand them. The game also has a tool for teachers, which allows for kids' progress to be checked on.
                  I wrote this code in python with the use of a library called <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">pygame</a>.<br>
                  The project is below as a downloadable link, have fun playing it.<br>
